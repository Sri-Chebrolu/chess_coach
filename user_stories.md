AI Chess Coach: User Stories & Requirements

Project Overview
A web-based interactive chess coaching platform that goes beyond "best move" suggestions. The app enables users to have a Socratic, principle-based conversation with an AI coach, model branching scenarios, and explore the "why" behind every position without the frustration of session timeouts.

Core User Stories (P0)
1. Game Ingestion & Session Persistence
1a. As a user, I want to upload my games via FEN strings or by logging into my Chess.com account, so that I can quickly start a review session.

1b. As a user, I want my session to remain active even if I switch apps or close my browser, so that I don't lose my progress due to aggressive timeouts.

2. Interactive Socratic Coaching
2a.As a user, I want to chat with the coach at any point in the game via text or voice, so that the interaction feels natural and accessible.

2b.As a user, I want the coach to ask me questions about my thought process rather than just giving me the answer, so that I actually learn to identify tactical patterns.

3. Scenario Modeling (The "What-If" Engine)
3a.As a user, I want to move pieces freely to explore different variations, so that I can test my hypotheses.

3b.As a user, I want to see a visual branching tree of these scenarios, so that I can compare different board states and their evaluations side-by-side.

3c.As a user, I want to have a conversation with the coach about multiple branches at once to understand the trade-offs between different lines.

4. Principle-Based Analysis
4a.As a user, I want the coach’s advice to be grounded in chess principles (e.g., center control, piece activity, king safety) rather than just raw engine scores, so that the feedback is human-readable and actionable.
